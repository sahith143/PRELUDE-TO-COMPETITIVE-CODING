Write a program to find wheather a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a number which has only 2 factors 1 and itself. It has not other factors. For example number 11 is prime , but number 10 is not prime because it has 1,2,5,10 as its factors.

Take n as input using scanf, Output "yes" if number is prime, otherwise print "no"

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner obj = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = obj.nextInt();
        for(int i=2;i<n;i++){
            if(n%i==0){
                System.out.println("no");
                break;
            }
            else{
                System.out.println("yes");
                break;
            }
